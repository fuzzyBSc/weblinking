If you want to run the automated test programs you'll want the following submodules:\r\n[submodule \"submodule/qunit\"]\r\n\tpath = submodule/qunit\r\n\turl = https://github.com/jquery/qunit.git\r\n\r\nAlso, grab the following and put them into the dependencies directory:\r\n* The google closure compiler.jar file - https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/\r\n* The js-uri URI.js file - http://code.google.com/p/js-uri/\r\n\r\nThe closure compiler is there to test how it behaves when included in a closure compile. The URI.js is there to resolve relative URIs. If you want to resolve relative URIs at runtime you'll need to be able to provide a function that resolves a relative URI string relative to a base URI object.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
